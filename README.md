## 🌍 About

**EcoLogits Calculator** is an open-source interactive tool for estimating the **energy consumption** and **environmental footprint** of generative AI models. Developed by the non-profit [GenAI Impact](https://genai-impact.org/), this calculator helps individuals, researchers, and organizations understand and evaluate the sustainability of AI usage.

The calculator provides:
- **Energy consumption estimates** for AI model inference
- **Environmental impact assessments** including carbon emissions and water usage
- **Real-world scaling analysis** to understand the broader impact
- **Support for multiple AI providers and models**
- **Educational insights** into sustainable AI practices

## ✨ Features

- **🧮 Interactive Calculator**: Easily estimate environmental impacts by selecting a provider, model, and example usage
- **🤓 Expert Mode**: Advanced options for users who want granular control over calculations
- **🪙 Token Estimator**: Understand tokenization and estimate token counts for your inputs
- **📊 Visualization**: Interactive charts showing environmental equivalences and scaling projections
- **🌐 Multi-Provider Support**: Evaluate impacts across different AI providers and models
- **📖 Methodology Documentation**: Transparent, science-backed calculation methods
- **📱 Web-Based Interface**: No installation needed—access directly through the web

## 🚀 Quick Start

The Calculator is currently hosted on Hugging Face Spaces and can be accessed directly [here](https://huggingface.co/spaces/genai-impact/ecologits-calculator).

If you want to run the calculator locally, follow the instructions below.

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+
- [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) package manager

### Installation

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/genai-impact/ecologits-calculator.git
cd ecologits-calculator

# Install dependencies using uv
uv sync

# Run the application
uv run streamlit run app.py
```

The calculator will open in your browser at `http://localhost:8501`

## 📚 How It Works
The basic workflow of the EcoLogits Calculator involves the following steps:
1. **Select Model**: Choose an AI provider and model from the available options
2. **Provide Input**: Enter example prompts or text that you want to evaluate
3. **View Results**: Instantly see energy consumption and environmental impact estimates
4. **Explore Equivalences**: Understand impacts in relatable terms (e.g., "equivalent to driving X km")
5. **Analyze Scaling**: See how impacts multiply when scaled to larger populations

### Key Metrics

- **Energy Consumption**: Measured in kWh per inference
- **Carbon Emissions**: Estimated CO₂ equivalent based on energy grid composition
- **Other Environmental Impacts**: Water usage, resource consumption, etc.
- **Scaling Analysis**: Projections for 1% of world population using the same prompt daily for one year
